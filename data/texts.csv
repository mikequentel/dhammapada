190,"190, 191, 192","He who takes refuge with Buddha, the Law, and the Church, he who, with clear understanding, sees the four holy truths--viz pain, the origin of pain, the destruction of pain, and the eightfold holy way that leads to the quieting of pain--that is the safe refuge, that is the best refuge , having gone to that refuge, a man is delivered from all pain."
193,193,"A supernatural person (a Buddha) is not easily found, he is not born everywhere. Wherever such a sage is born, that race prospers."
194,194,"Happy is the arising of the awakened, happy is the teaching of the True Law, happy is peace in the church, happy is the devotion of those who are at peace."
195,"195, 196","He who pays homage to those who deserve homage, whether the awakened (Buddha) or their disciples, those who have overcome the host (of evils), and crossed the flood of sorrow, he who pays homage to such as have found deliverance and know no fear, his merit can never be measured by anybody."
197,197,"We live happily indeed, not hating those who hate us; among men who hate us we dwell free from hatred."
198,198,"We live happily indeed, free from ailments among the ailing; among men who are ailing let us dwell free from ailments."
199,199,"We live happily indeed, free from greed among the greedy; among men who are greedy let us dwell free from greed."
200,200,"We live happily indeed, though we call nothing our own. We shall be like the bright gods, feeding on happiness."
201,201,"Victory breeds hatred, for the conquered is unhappy. He who has given up both victory and defeat, he, the contented, is happy."
202,202,"There is no fire like passion, there is no losing throw like hatred, there is no pain like this body, there is no happiness higher than rest."
203,203,"Hunger is the worst of diseases, the elements of the body the greatest evil, if one knows this truly, that is Nirvana, the highest happiness."
204,204,"Health is the greatest of gifts, contentedness the best riches , trust is the best of relationships, Nirvana the highest happiness."
205,205,"He who has tasted the sweetness of solitude and tranquillity, is free from fear and free from sin, while he tastes the sweetness of drinking in the law."
206,206,"The sight of the elect (Arya) is good, to live with them is always happiness; if a man does not see fools, he will be truly happy."
207,207,"He who walks in the company of fools suffers a long way; company with fools, as with an enemy, is always painful; company with the wise is pleasure, like meeting with kinsfolk."
208,208,"Therefore, one ought to follow the wise, the intelligent, the learned, the much enduring, the dutiful, the elect; one ought to follow such a good and wise man, as the moon follows the path of the stars."
209,209,"He who gives himself to vanity, and does not give himself to meditation, forgetting the real aim (of life) and grasping at pleasure, will in time envy him who has exerted himself in meditation."
210,210,"Let no man ever cling to what is pleasant, or to what is unpleasant. Not to see what is pleasant is pain, and it is pain to see what is unpleasant."
211,211,"Let, therefore, no man love anything, loss of the beloved is evil. Those who love nothing, and hate nothing, have no fetters."
212,212,"From pleasure comes grief, from pleasure comes fear, he who is free from pleasure knows neither grief nor fear."
213,213,"From affection comes grief, from affection comes fear, he who is free from affection knows neither grief nor fear."
214,214,"From lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust knows neither grief nor fear."
215,215,"From love comes grief, from love comes fear; he who is free from love knows neither grief nor fear."
216,216,"From greed comes grief, from greed comes fear; he who is free from greed knows neither grief nor fear."
217,217,"He who possesses virtue and intelligence, who is just, speaks the truth, and does what is his own business, him the world will hold dear."
218,218,"He in whom a desire for the Ineffable (Nirvana) has sprung up, who in his mind is satisfied, and whose thoughts are not bewildered by love, he is called urdhvamsrotas (carried upwards by the stream)."
219,219,"Kinsmen, friends, and lovers salute a man who has been long away, and returns safe from afar."
220,220,"In like manner his good works receive him who has done good, and has gone from this world to the other--as kinsmen receive a friend on his return."
221,221,"Let a man leave anger, let him forsake pride, let him overcome all bondage! No sufferings befall the man who is not attached to name and form, and who calls nothing his own."
222,222,"He who holds back rising anger like a rolling chariot, him I call a real driver; other people are but holding the reins."
223,223,"Let a man overcome anger by love, let him overcome evil by good, let him overcome the greedy by liberality, the liar by truth!"
224,224,"Speak the truth, do not yield to anger; give, if thou art asked for little--by these three steps thou wilt go near the gods."
225,225,"The sages who injure nobody, and who always control their body, they will go to the unchangeable place (Nirvana), where, if they have gone, they will suffer no more."
226,226,"Those who are ever watchful, who study day and night, and who strive after Nirvana, their passions will come to an end."
227,227,"This is an old saying, O Atula, this is not as if of today: ‘They blame him who sits silent, they blame him who speaks much, they also blame him who says little; there is no one on earth who is not blamed’."
228,228,"There never was, there never will be, nor is there now, a man who is always blamed, or a man who is always praised."
229,"229, 230","But he whom those who discriminate praise continually day after day, as without blemish, wise, rich in knowledge and virtue, who would dare to blame him, like a coin made of gold from the Gambu river? Even the gods praise him; he is praised even by Brahman."
231,231,"Beware of bodily anger, and control thy body! Leave the sins of the body, and with thy body practise virtue."
232,232,"Beware of the anger of the tongue, and control thy tongue! Leave the sins of the tongue, and practise virtue with thy tongue!"
233,233,"Beware of the anger of the mind, and control thy mind! Leave the sins of the mind, and practise virtue with thy mind!"
234,234,"The wise who control their body, who control their tongue, the wise who control their mind, are indeed well controlled."
235,235,"Thou art now like a sear leaf, the messengers of death (Yama) have come near to thee, thou standest at the door of thy departure, and thou hast no provision for thy journey."
236,236,"Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise I When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt enter into the heavenly world of the elect (Anya)."
237,237,"Thy life has come to an end, thou art come near to death (Yama), there is no resting-place for thee on the road, and thou hast no provision for thy journey."
238,238,"Make thyself an island, work hard, be wise! When thy impurities are blown away, and thou art free from guilt, thou wilt not enter again into birth and decay."
239,239,"Let a wise man blow off the impurities of himself, as a smith blows off the impurities of silver, one by one, little by little, and from time to time."
240,240,"As the impurity which springs from the iron, when it springs from it, destroys it, thus do a transgressor’s own works lead him to the evil path."
241,241,"The taint of prayers is non-repetition, the taint of houses, non-repair, the taint of complexion is sloth, the taint of a watchman, thoughtlessness."
242,242,"Bad conduct is the taint of woman, niggardliness the taint of a benefactor, tainted are all evil ways, in this world and in the next."
243,243,"But there is a taint worse than all taints--ignorance is the greatest taint. O mendicants l throw off that taint, and become taintless!"
244,244,"Life is easy to live for a man who is without shame; a crow hero, a mischief-maker, an insulting, bold, and wretched fellow."
245,245,"But life is hard to live for a modest man, who always looks for what is pure, who is disinterested, quiet, spotless, and intelligent."
246,"246, 247","He who destroys life, who speaks untruth, who in the world takes what is not given him, who goes to another man’s wife, and the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating liquors, he, even in this world, digs up his own root."
248,248,"O man, know this, that the unrestrained are in a bad state; take care that greediness and vice do not bring thee to grief for a long time!"
249,249,"The world gives according to their faith or according to their pleasure. If a man frets about the food and the drink given to others, he will find no rest either by day or by night."
250,250,"He in whom that feeling is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, finds rest by day and by night."
251,251,"There is no fire like passion, there is no shark like hatred, there is no snare like folly, there is no torrent like greed."
252,252,"The fault of others is easily perceived, but that of oneself is difficult to perceive; a man winnows his neighbour’s faults like chaff, but his own fault he hides, as a cheat hides the bad die from the player."
253,253,"If a man looks after the faults of others, and is always inclined to be offended, his own passions will grow, and he is far from the destruction of passions."
254,254,"There is no path through the air; a man is not a Samana outwardly. The world delights in vanity, the Tathigatas (the Buddhas) are free from vanity."
255,255,"There is no path through the air, a man is not a Samana outwardly. No creatures are eternal, but the awakened (Buddha) are never shaken."
256,"256, 257","A man is not just if he carries a matter by violence; no--he who distinguishes both right and wrong, who is learned and guides others, not by violence, but by the same law, being a guardian of the law and intelligent, he is called just."
258,258,"A man is not learned because he talks much; he who is patient, free from hatred and fear, he is called learned."
259,259,"A man is not a supporter of the law because he talks much; even if a man has learnt little, but sees the law bodily, he is a supporter of the law--a man who never neglects the law."
260,260,"A man is not an elder because his head is grey; his age may be ripe, but he is called ‘old-in-vain’."
261,261,"He in whom there is truth, virtue, pity, restraint, moderation, he who is free from impurity and is wise, he is called an elder."
262,262,"An envious, stingy, dishonest man does not become respectable by means of much talking only, or by the beauty of his complexion."
263,263,"He in whom all this is destroyed, and taken out with the very root, he, when freed from hatred and wise, is called respectable."
264,264,Not by tonsure does an undisciplined man who speaks falsehood become a Samana; can a man be a Samana who is still held captive by desire and greediness?
265,265,"He who always quiets the evil, whether small or large, he is called a Samana (a quiet man), because he has quieted all evil."
266,266,"A man is not a mendicant (Bhikshu) simply because he asks others for alms; he who adopts the whole law is a Bhikshu, not he who only begs."
267,267,"He who is above good and evil, who is chaste, who with care passes through the world, he indeed is called a Bhikshu."
268,"268, 269","A man is not a Muni because he observes silence (mona, ie mauna)--if he is foolish and ignorant, but the wise who, as with the balance chooses the good and avoids evil, he is a Muni, and is a Muni thereby, he who in this world weighs both sides is called a Muni."
270,270,"A man is not an elect (Ariya) because he injures living creatures; because he has pity on all living creatures, therefore is a man called Ariya."
271,"271, 272","Not only by discipline and vows, not only by much learning, not by entering into a trance, not by sleeping alone, do I earn the happiness of release which no worldling can know. O Bhikshu, he who has obtained the extinction of desires, has obtained confidence."
273,273,"The best of ways is the eightfold, the best of truths the four words, the best of virtues passionlessness; the best of men he who has eyes to see."
274,274,"This is the way, there is no other that leads to the purifying of intelligence. Go on this path!This is the confusion of Mara (the tempter)."
275,275,"If you go on this way, you will make an end of pain! The way was preached by me, when I had understood the removal of the thorns (in the flesh)."
276,276,You yourself must make an effort. The Tathigatas (Buddhas) are only preachers. The thoughtful who enter the way are freed from the bondage of Mara.
277,277,'All created things perish'--he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way to purity.
278,278,'Allcreated things are grief and pain’--he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.
279,279,'All forms are unreal’--he who knows and sees this becomes passive in pain; this is the way that leads to purity.
280,280,"He who does not rouse himself when it is time to rise, who, though young and strong, is full of sloth, whose will and thought are weak--that lazy and idle man never finds the way to knowledge."
281,281,"Watching his speech, well restrained in mind, let a man never commit any wrong with his body! Let a man but keep these three roads of action clear, and he will achieve the way which is taught by the wise."
282,282,"Through zeal knowledge is gotten, through lack of zeal knowledge is lost; let a man who knows this double path of gain and loss thus place himself that knowledge may grow."
283,283,"Cut down the whole forest (of desires), not a tree only! Danger comes out of the forest (of desires). When you have cut down both the forest (of desires) and its undergrowth, then, Bhikshus, you will be rid of the forest and of desires!"
284,284,"So long as the desire of man towards women, even the smallest, is not destroyed, so long is his mind in bondage, as the calf that drinks milk is to its mother."
285,285,"Cut out the love of self, like an autumn lotus, with thy hand! Cherish the road of peace. Nirvana has been shown by Sugata (Buddha)."
286,286,"'Here I shall dwell in the rain, here in winter and summer’; thus the fool meditates, and does not think of death."
287,287,"Death comes and carries off that man, honoured for his children and flocks, his mind distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village."
288,288,"Sons are no help, nor a father, nor relations; there is no help from kinsfolk for one whom death has seized."
289,289,"A wise and well-behaved man who knows the meaning of this, should quickly clear the way that leads to Nirvana."
290,290,"If by leaving a small pleasure one sees a great pleasure, let-a wise man leave the small pleasure, and look to the great."
291,291,"He who, by causing pain to others, wishes to obtain pleasure for himself, he, entangled in the bonds of hatred, will never be free from hatred."
292,292,"What ought to be done is neglected, what ought not to be done is done; the desires of unruly, thoughtless people are always increasing."
293,293,"But they whose whole watchfulness is always directed to their body, who do not follow what ought not to be done, and who steadfastly do what ought to be done--the desires of such watchful and wise people will come to an end."
294,294,"A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two valiant kings, though he has destroyed a kingdom with all its subjects."
295,295,"A true Brahmana goes scatheless, though he have killed father and mother, and two holy kings, and an eminent man besides."
296,296,"The disciples of Gotama (Buddha) are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on Buddha."
297,297,"The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the law."
298,298,"The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on the church."
299,299,"The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their thoughts day and night are always set on their body."
300,300,"The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind, day and night, always delights in compassion."
301,301,"The disciples of Gotama are always well awake, and their mind, day and night, always delights in meditation."
302,302,"It is hard to leave the world (to become a friar); it is hard to enjoy the world; hard is the monastery, painful are the houses, painful it is to dwell with equals (to share everything in common), and the itinerant mendicant is beset with pain. Therefore let no man be an itinerant mendicant, and he will not be beset with pain."
303,303,"A man full of faith, if endowed with virtue and glory, is respected, whatever place he may choose."
304,304,"Good people shine from afar, like the snowy mountains; bad people are not seen, like arrows shot by night."
305,305,"Sitting alone, lying down alone, walking alone without ceasing, and alone subduing himself, let a man be happy near the edge of a forest."
306,306,"He who says what is not, goes to hell; he also who, having done a thing, says I have not done it. After death both are equal, they are men with evil deeds in the next world."
307,307,Many men whose shoulders are covered with the yellow gown are ill-conditioned and unrestrained--such evil-doers by their evil deeds go to hell.
308,308,"Better it would be to swallow a heated iron ball, like flaring fire, than that a bad unrestrained fellow should live on the charity of the land."
309,309,"Four things does a reckless man gain who covets his neighbours wife: demerit, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, punishment, and lastly, hell."
310,310,"There is demerit, and the evil way (to hell); there is the short pleasure of the frightened in the arms of the frightened, and the king imposes heavy punishment; therefore, let no man think of his neighbour’s wife."
311,311,"As a grass-blade, if badly grasped, cuts the arm, badly-practised asceticism leads to hell."
312,312,"An act carelessly performed, a broken vow, and hesitating obedience to discipline (Brahmakariyam)--all this brings no great reward."
313,313,"If anything is to be done, let a man do it, let him attack it vigorously! A careless pilgrim only scatters the dust of his passions more widely."
314,314,"An evil deed is better left undone, for a man repents of it afterwards; a good deed is better done, for having done it, one does not repent."
315,315,"Like a well-guarded frontier fort, with defences within and without, so let a man guard himself. Not a moment should escape; for they who allow the right moment to pass, suffer pain when they are in hell."
316,316,"They who are ashamed of what they ought not to be ashamed of, and are not ashamed of what they ought to be ashamed of, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path."
317,317,"They who fear when they ought not to fear, and fear not when they ought to fear, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path."
318,318,"They who see sin where there is no sin, and see no sin where there is sin, such men, embracing false doctrines, enter the evil path."
319,319,"They who see sin where there is sin, and no sin where there is no sin, such men, embracing the true doctrine, enter the good path."
320,320,"Silently I endured abuse as the elephant in battle endures the arrow sent from the bow, for the world is ill-natured."
321,321,"They lead a tamed elephant to battle, the king mounts a tamed elephant, the tamed is the best among men, he who silently endures abuse."
322,322,"Mules are good, if tamed, and noble Sindhu horses, and elephants with large tusks; but he who tames himself is better still."
323,323,"For with these animals does no man reach the untrodden country (Nirvana), where a tamed man goes on a tamed animal, viz on his own welltamed self."
324,324,"The elephant called Dhanapilaka, his temples running with pungent sap, and who is difficult to hold, does not eat a morsel when bound; the elephant longs for the elephant grove."
325,325,"If a man becomes fat and a great eater, if he is sleepy and rolls himself about, that fool, like a hog fed on grains, is born again and again."
326,326,"This mind of mine went formerly wandering about as it liked, as it listed, as it pleased; but I shall now hold it in thoroughly, as the rider who holds the hook holds in the furious elephant."
327,327,"Be not thoughtless, watch your thoughts! Draw yourself out of the evil way, like an elephant sunk in mud."
